          Prizes will be awarded only if an eligible entrant achieves a

          <strong>Introduction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          WinStreak Sports invites participants to compete by submitting
          predictions concerning the success of professional sports teams. The
          object of WinStreak is to establish and build a virtual "win streak"
          by making correct consecutive predictions regarding which teams will
          win on a particular game day.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enter, you must register for WinStreak via WinStreakSports.com or
          the WinStreak Sports App (as defined below), enter a contest, and
          then, select eligible teams that you predict will win the specified
          game (each such prediction, a "Pick"). Your WinStreak score
          ("WinStreak") is measured as the number of correct picks in a row
          without an incorrect pick. WinStreak is subject to all applicable
          laws, rules, and regulations. Void where prohibited or restricted by
          law, rule, or regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Eligibility</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          WinStreak is open only to legal residents of the United States, who
          are, as of the date of WinStreak registration, registered users of
          WinStreakSports.com, legal age of majority in their jurisdiction of
          residence and at least twenty-one (21) years old, and not otherwise
          ineligible per the terms of this Section 2. Excluded individuals may
          play, but WILL NOT be eligible to receive any prize.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employees, officers, and directors and their immediate family members
          (spouse, parent, child, sibling, and their respective spouses,
          regardless of where they reside) and members of the same household
          (whether or not related) of WinStreak Sports or any contest sponsor,
          the other WinStreak entities (as defined below), each of their
          respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, governors,
          related entities, partners, partnerships, principals, licensees,
          sponsors, and advertising/promotion agencies, any contest prize
          provider or commercial sponsor, and any other entity associated with
          WinStreak, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees,
          agents, representatives, successors, and assigns (collectively,
          "Promotion Parties") are not eligible to participate or win. The
          "WinStreak entities" shall mean Sponsors, each of their parent,
          subsidiary, affiliated and related entities, any entity which, now or
          in the future, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
          with the sponsors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Entry Period and Lock Time</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The entry period for WinStreak contests will begin at the time
          specified on the website or app, and end upon a user winning a
          contest, or at the conclusion of the final game of the league’s
          regular season (the “WinStreak Entry Period”). Your Picks for a
          particular game day must be recorded before Lock Time (as defined
          below). If you do not timely submit a Pick for any particular game
          day, your WinStreak will not end and revert to zero. Instead, your
          WinStreak will hold at its then-current number, until it either grows
          or reverts to zero as described in Section 6 below.
        </p>
        <p>
          For purposes of WinStreak, “Lock Time” means the scheduled start time
          of the game in which your Pick is scheduled to participate. For
          example, if a team is scheduled to begin a game at 7:00 p.m. ET on a
          particular game day, the Lock Time by which any Pick from that game
          must be recorded is 7:00 p.m. ET of such game day, regardless of
          whether the game actually begins at such time or later. You can submit
          your Picks as early as X days prior to the relevant game day, provided
          that if the contest Start Time is less than X days before any game
          day, you can submit your Picks for such game day as early as the
          contest Start Time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Regarding Changes to schedule:</strong> The menu from which
          you make your Pick is specific to both game day and match-up. If there
          are any official schedule changes such that your Pick does not play on
          the game day or in the match-up that was designated in the selection
          menu, for example due to cancellation because of extreme weather, your
          Pick will be ruled “void” and your WinStreak will not be affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the game is made up the following day, you will have to make your
          Pick again from the selection menu, which will display the updated
          date and start time. Please note that the selection menu will be
          updated only after changes have been made official. For example, if
          there is an announcement that “Game X” will be postponed and made up
          at a later date, the selection menu will show Game X as an option only
          after it has been officially added to the league’s official schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Regarding Double-Headers:</strong> In the event that a team
          plays two games in one day, each game’s start time will be specified
          and you will be making your Pick from each individual game. Also, note
          that, if you so desire, you may pick the same team for each game of a
          double-header.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>WinStreak Registration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To enter a contest on WinStreak, you must (a) be a registered user of
          WinStreak Sports and (b) enter the contest at WinStreakSports.com or
          via the WinStreak mobile app (“App”). On the WinStreak Sports website
          click on the sign-up button and then complete and submit the WinStreak
          Sports sign-up form. Alternatively, you may download and install the
          App on your smartphone or other mobile device and register for
          WinStreak Sports via the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          By fully completing and submitting all information required for
          WinStreak Sports registration, including your date of birth, and
          confirming your agreement to these Terms of Use, you will be
          registered as a WinStreak Sports user. WinStreak Sports registration
          is free. Data and usage rates may apply to download, installation, and
          use of the App or of a mobile phone or other web-enabled device; check
          with your service provider for details on these and other charges.
          Wireless service is not available in all areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the WinStreak Contest Entry Period, WinStreak Sports may
          release updates to the App and notify you of the availability of such
          updates via in-App messaging or other means. Be sure to install these
          updates to participate in WinStreak contests via the App. If you do
          not install updates to the App when they are available, you may not be
          able to participate in WinStreak contests via the App. Incomplete
          WinStreak registrations are void. Participants are responsible for
          ensuring all their contact information is up-to-date and accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>WinStreak Entry; Entry Limit</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          One (1) WinStreak entry consists of an initial Pick submitted when
          your WinStreak is at zero and all subsequent consecutive Picks, until
          you submit an incorrect Pick and your Streak reverts to zero (or
          contest concludes). Limit one (1) WinStreak registration per person,
          per email address, and per contest for the duration of each individual
          contest. Additional WinStreak registrations received from any
          person/email address will be void.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no limit to how often you can attempt to build a new Streak
          after reverting to zero, and therefore no limit on the number of
          entries you can submit in a WinStreak contest. You cannot, however,
          submit or manage simultaneous entries. The use of a script, macro, or
          any other device to automate or subvert the contest registration or
          entry process is prohibited and all such registrations and entries
          will be void. Sponsor reserves the right to permanently disqualify any
          person it believes has intentionally violated these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Establishing and Maintaining a WinStreak; Scoring:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your WinStreak is measured by the number of correct predictions you
          make, subject to the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          You will achieve a WinStreak of one (1) upon your first correct Pick
          (i.e., your Pick wins the specified game), so long as the game started
          and lasted the requisite amount of time to be considered “official”.
        </p>
        <p>Your Streak will increase by one (1) with each next Win.</p>
        <p>
          Your Streak will hold at its then current-number under any of the
          following scenarios (each such scenario, a "Void"):
        </p>
        <p>A. your Pick does not play on the specified date, for any reason;</p>
        <p>
          B. the game in which your Pick is scheduled to play is suspended and,
          (a) continued at a later date, or (b) the game is ruled “not official”
          by the league and is restarted at a later date;
        </p>
        <p>D. you do not timely submit a Pick on a given day</p>
        <p>
          If your Pick is neither a Win nor Loss (i.e. draw), your Pick is
          considered incorrect. In such case, your Streak will end and revert to
          zero. In such event, you may establish a new Streak and compete again
          by re-entering the contest and submitting further Picks.
        </p>
        <p>
          WinStreak will allow entrants to make as many picks as desired for a
          particular game day, and potentially increase a WinStreak by as many
          games as are happening on the given game day.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may submit multiple Picks for any game day, so long as your Picks
          are recorded prior to their applicable Lock Times. In other words, if
          you submit one (1) Pick and wish to submit subsequent Picks, you may
          do so as long as the Lock Time for your Pick has not yet passed. You
          may add subsequent Picks after the Lock Time of your first prediction
          has passed, provided the Lock Time of the subsequent Pick(s) has not
          yet passes. You cannot change any of your Picks after the applicable
          Lock Time. In other words, you can make a prediction on any game so
          long as that particular game has not started yet. The outcomes of your
          multiple Picks will be scored and impact your Streak as detailed
          below:
        </p>
        <p>
          All Picks that have locked (i.e. their Lock Time has passed) will be
          settled and applied to your score, regardless of whether or not you
          reached a WinStreak of contest-winning length. This means even if you
          cross the winning threshold, your score is beholden to the results of
          all ongoing locked Picks, as detailed in the example below:
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: You make 12 picks, 10 of which have Lock Times of 1:00 PM ET.
          The other two have Lock Times of 2:00 PM ET. At 2:30 PM ET, the first
          10 games end, and you win all 10. Your WinStreak is now 10, which is
          the specified length to win the contest. However, you still have two
          ongoing Picks, which will affect your score normally. Because these
          picks locked before the contest ended, their results will apply to
          your score. At 3:30 PM ET, one of your Picks loses, and thus your
          score is reverted to zero (0).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponsor reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to correct and
          update Streak scores based on errors or irregularities in the
          tabulation or transmission of entries or Streaks. The decisions of
          Sponsor are final and binding with respect to WinStreak scoring and in
          all other WinStreak matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Prize; Prize Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          WinStreak features one (1) Grand Prize for each contest, as set forth
          below. Only one (1) prize will be awarded, subject to the WinStreak
          requirements. No prize will be awarded if no entrant reaches the
          specified requirements prior to the end of the league’s season. If
          multiple entrants achieve the specified requirements, they will split
          the Grand Prize evenly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Grand Prize" is clearly specified for each contest. GRAND PRIZE
          WILL ONLY BE AWARDED IF AN ELIGIBLE ENTRANT ACHIEVES A WINSTREAK OF
          THE SPECIFIED LENGTH OR GREATER, WITHOUT AN INCORRECT PICK, AND AS
          DETERMINED BY SPONSOR, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS. IF NO ELIGIBLE
          ENTRANT ACHIEVES A WINSTREAK OF THE SPECIFIED LENGTH OR GREATER, THE
          GRAND PRIZE WILL NOT BE AWARDED FOR THAT CONTEST.
        </p>
        <p>
          Winner is fully responsible for any and all applicable taxes
          (including income and withholding taxes). All costs and expenses
          associated with acceptance and use of any prize which are not
          specifically described as being provided by Sponsor are the sole
          responsibility of the winner. All prize details are at Sponsor's sole
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Determining the Winner; Notification</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these
          Terms, the eligible entrant who first achieves a WinStreak of the
          specified length (if any) will win the Grand Prize, provided that a
          tie will be declared if multiple entrants make such achievement on
          games with the same Lock Times. In the event of a tie (i.e., two (2)
          or more eligible entrants achieve a WinStreak of the specified length
          on games with the same start time, the Grand Prize, as applicable,
          will be divided equally among the tied, eligible participants.
        </p>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
        <p>
          If two (2) or more entrants achieve a WinStreak of the specified
          length on games with the same Lock Times, a tie will be declared even
          if one (1) such entrants’ WinStreak reaches the specified number
          before the other, and the prize will be split evenly between the
          entrants. For example, if an entrant achieves a WinStreak of the
          specified length at 3:00 p.m. ET and another entrant achieves a
          WinStreak of the same length at 4:00 p.m. ET, a tie will be declared
          if the games had identical Lock Times.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an entrant has a WinStreak lower than the specified amount, and
          makes multiple Picks, one of the outcomes of which includes a Loss,
          such entrant’s Streak would end and revert to zero, regardless of
          whether the entrant reached the specified milestone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The potential winner will be notified by email within approximately
          three (3) business days following the conclusion of the WinStreak
          contest. Entrants are solely responsible for monitoring their email
          for WinStreak-related notifications. Sponsor will have the right, in
          its discretion, to require proof of identity and/or eligibility in a
          form acceptable to Sponsor (for example, government-issued photo
          identification) for winner verification purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to receive a prize, the potential winners may be required to
          execute and return an Affidavit of Eligibility & Liability Release and
          (where legal) Publicity Release, and any other documents required by
          Sponsor, within five (5) business days of date of issuance. The
          potential winner will be required to submit his/her valid social
          security number and will receive an IRS Form 1099 for any prize valued
          at $600 or greater.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable or is
          declined, if Sponsor is unable to contact a potential winner, if the
          potential winner does not timely respond to prize notification or
          document requirements, or if a potential winner is not in compliance
          with these Terms, such potential winner will be disqualified and the
          prize in question will go unawarded, provided however that in the
          event of a tie, the prize may be awarded to the remaining,
          non-disqualified potential winner(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          The prize will be awarded only to the Authorized Account Holder of the
          email address used for WinStreak Sports registration (subject to
          verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules).
          The “Authorized Account Holder” is the natural person to whom the
          applicable ISP or other organization (such as a business or
          educational institution) has assigned the submitted email address for
          the domain associated with such email address.

          requirements, the WinStreak Sports website Privacy Policy, and the

          respects and (b) gives his/her express permission to be contacted by
          Sponsor and/or its representatives for administration purposes.

        <p>
          No transfer, assignment, cash redemption, or substitution of a prize
          (or portion thereof) is permitted except by Sponsor, who reserves the
          right to substitute a prize (or portion thereof) with one of
          comparable or greater value as determined by Sponsor. Participation in
          WinStreak contests is at participant's own risk. Game dates and times
          are determined in the sole discretion of the applicable leagues and
          may be subject to change.
